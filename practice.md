# Hello

## Slob was Here

### so was I

### getting smaller

#### don't exceed this

this is a -- wrong em dash

an em dash in inline code `hotrod -- --debug`

```bash
$> env
```

## Possessive
Do not use the Server's API in Hotrod's environment.

- dfsdf
- sdfsdf
- sdfsdf

* dfgdfg
* dfgdfg
* fdgdfg

99% of `actions` require JSON.

`http-input` splits input across multiple lines and that renders the individual
lines to be invalid JSON within themselves.

By default we assume we're dealing with newline-delimited JSON.

Unless the API returns multiple JSON objects that are newline delimited.

## this is not right caps

Use Pipelang not Pipe language not pipe language not pipelang not pipes language

The agent connects to the server to poll for updated pipes.

## The agent was Here

```sh
$> hotrod agent update
```

```python
import sdfsdf
```

`hotrod run agent`
